    <description>Launchy is a free cross-platform utility designed to help you forget about your start menu,
    the icons on your desktop, and even your file manager.
    Launchy indexes the programs in your start menu and can launch your documents, project files, folders,
    and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes!

    <releaseNotes>Launchy hasn't been updated in a while; for some people the 2.6 beta works better than the 2.5 release (which is available in its own Chocolatey package).</releaseNotes>
