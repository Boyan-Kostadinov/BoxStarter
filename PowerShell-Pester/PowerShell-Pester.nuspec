    Pester provides a framework for running unit tests to execute and validate PowerShell commands from within PowerShell.
    Pester consists of a simple set of functions that expose a testing domain-specific language (DSL) for isolating,
    running, evaluating and reporting the results of PowerShell commands.

    Pester tests can execute any command or script that is accessible to a Pester test file. This can include functions,
    cmdlets, modules and scripts. Pester can be run in ad-hoc style in a console or it can be integrated into the build
    scripts of a continuous integration (CI) system.

    Pester also contains a powerful set of mocking functions in which tests mimic any command functionality within the tested PowerShell code.
