    Tag Your Movies To Look Perfect in iTunes, Apple TV or other Media Players.

    With only a mouse click or two, MetaX will scour all the major sources of movie
    and TV information on the web: TVDB, TheMovieDB, iTunes as well as IMDB and
    Yahoo posters and display the information. You can select from multiple entries
    to get just the look you want, then quickly write the tags into the file so that
    it shows up in iTunes, Apple TV or whatever media play you use, just like it would
    if you had purchased the movie from iTunes.
    MetaX supports MP4, M4V, MOV, AVI, MKV and WMV files.
    Not all formats support all tags. AVI files in particular don't support most tags,
    including not supporting cover art.
