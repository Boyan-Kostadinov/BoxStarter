    <description>psake is a build automation tool written in PowerShell. It avoids the angle-bracket tax associated with executable XML by leveraging the PowerShell syntax in your build scripts. psake has a syntax inspired by rake (aka make in Ruby) and bake (aka make in Boo), but is easier to script because it leverages your existent command-line knowledge. psake is pronounced sake - as in Japanese rice wine. It does NOT rhyme with make, bake, or rake. You can also install with chocolatey (http://nuget.org/List/Packages/chocolatey) and have global psake.</description>
